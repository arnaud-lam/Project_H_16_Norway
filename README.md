Done for the European Project Semester at Høgskolen i Oslo og Akershus, Norway, for the 2016 Fall Semester.

The main goal of this project was to know if it was possible to detect a mechanical movement in tissue where the arteries are 
by using an optical mouse as a sensor. By doing so, the mouse would serve as a continuous measurement instrument of blood flow.

You can find on this repository the final version of our Research Report.

You'll also find the 3D Model of the prototype we designed for the project in under the folder "Prototype 3D Model".

It contains 6 files : 
“higher-v3.SLDPRT” and “lower-v3.SLDPRT”, which are the SolidWorks files. 
“higher-v3.stl” and “lower-v3.stl”, which are the SolidWorks files converted to a standard 3D Model file extension. 
“UM2+_higher-v3.gcode” and “UM2+_lower-v3.gcode”, which are the STIL files converted to a standard printable file extension.
The gcode files contains the parameters used for the printing.


Also, the Arduino and Processing code used to display the view of the mouse's camera is given here, largely based on the one done 
Conor Peterson, who gave his code on this webpage https://conorpeterson.wordpress.com/2010/06/04/optical-mouse-hacking-part-1/
